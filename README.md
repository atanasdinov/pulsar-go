# Apache Pulsar Golang Client Library

A Go client library for the [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) project.

## Benefits over other Pulsar Go libraries

* Faster message processing
* Pure Golang, works without use of Cgo
* Idiomatic and cleaner Go
* Better stability
* Higher test coverage
* Pluggable logger interface

## Status

The library is in an early state of development, the API is not stable yet.
Any help or input is welcome.
